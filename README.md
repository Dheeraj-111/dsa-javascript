# DSA Practice in JavaScript

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository! This repo contains my solutions to various DSA problems as I prepare for technical interviews.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- [Arrays](./arrays/)
- [Strings](./strings/)
- [Sorting Algorithms](./sorting/)
- [Searching Algorithms](./searching/)
- [Dynamic Programming](./dynamic-programming/)
- [Recursion](./recursion/)
- [Miscellaneous](./miscellaneous/)

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve at least 3-5 problems per week
- Understand time and space complexity for each solution
- Practice different problem-solving patterns
- Build strong foundations for technical interviews

## 📊 Progress Tracker

| Topic | Problems Solved | Status |

## 🛠️ How to Run

Each problem has its own file with the solution and test cases. To run any solution:

```bash
node arrays/problem-name.js
```

## 📝 Problem Format

Each problem file contains:
- Problem statement
- Examples
- Constraints
- Solution with comments
- Time & Space complexity analysis
- Test cases
